This project is a React-based Payments Dashboard UI.
The dashboard allows users to:

1. Select a company from a dropdown
2. Select an account belonging to that company
3. View the available balance of the selected account
4. View a transactions table that updates dynamically

Steps:
1. Clone the repository/copy the code of all the files.
2. Install dependencies (npm install)
3. Run the development server (npm run dev)
4. Open the URL shown in the terminal
5. Perform the required operations

Working:
1. Mock API data is stored in a separate file (companies.js)
2. React reads this data and stores selections using useState
3. Dropdown selections control which data is shown
4. UI updates automatically when selections change
